**Steps**
1. Download the data set data.csv from the Resources tab.
2. Import the data as a pandas DataFrame.
3. Check the number of observations.
4. Obtain the column headings.
5. Check the data type for each column.
6. Check if there are any missing values.
7. If necessary remove any observations to ensure that there are no missing values and the values in each column are of the same data type.
8. Obtain the mean, minimum and maximum value for each column containing numerical data.
9. List the 10 happiest countries.
10. List the 10 least happy countries.

**Edits**
1. Obtain a horizontal bar plot of the Happiness Score of the top 10 countries. Your bar chart should have the names of the countries are listed vertically along the y-axis and the x-axis should have labels for each number from 0 to 8. Ensure that the chart has an appropriate title and labels.
2. You will now modify the bar chart you obtained in step 1 to turn into a stacked bar chart where the overall happiness score is divided into the seven parts corresponding to the columns:
  * Economy
  * Family
  * Health
  * Freedom
  * Generosity
  * Corruption
  * Dystopia  
  Choose a distinct color for each category and include an appropriate legend with your chart.
3. Obtain the same stacked horizontal bar chart as in step 2 but this time instead of the top 10 countries consider all countries from the region Africa.
